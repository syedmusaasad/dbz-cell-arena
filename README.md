# DBZ: Cell Arena

The following technical sample provides documentation for major functionalities of a ROBLOX battlegrounds game I worked on during the summer of 2020. Minor features and functionalities have been excluded in the documentation, however the whole project is available in the `game` folder.

## Documentation

### 1. Entering the Game

The relevant code for the `STATS` is located in `StarterGui > ScreenGui > Stats > Stats.lua`. The values for yen, kills, and damage are stored using a data persistence API provided by ROBLOX and then output to the `STATS`.
